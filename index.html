	<h2>Origins</h2>
<img src="DL_images/DAn_Crime.JPG" alt="origins" title="Dan contemplates." height="250" width="250" class="align-left" />
<p> I was born in Omaha, NE and raised in Council Bluffs, IA
	I was raised by my mom, as a single parent, with a brother and a sister. 
	I am the oldest. We lived in a small house on the south end of CB on a dead end street near a creek. 
	I went to several elementary schools as a kid. I was bullied a lot by kids in every school I went to. 
	But I excelled in class, mostly math and art. My mom was a print press operator so she would bring home big rolls of paper that I would use to draw all sorts of characters. 
	I hung out with some neighborhood kids, riding bikes and sneaking through train yards.</p> 
<p> I was sort of close with a couple cousins on my mom's side, but not really close with many family members. 
	I would mostly hang out with my friends from the neighborhood, Seth, Johnny, Luke were all kids I went to school with and lived in the area.
	I went to High school at Abraham Lincoln High School in CB. I took a lot of art classes and drew a lot through high school. I was also on the football team for all 4 years. 
	I dabbled in track and power lifting as well. I spent about 2 weeks on the debate team. 
	Outside of school I listened to music and watched movies.</p>
